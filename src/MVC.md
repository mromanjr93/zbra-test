MVC is a standard that defines the separation of Model, View, Controller, 
often used in web applications and that aims to separate the responsibilities of interaction with users (Views), 
the definition of data modeling (Model) and an intermediary between Model and View called Controller, responsible for managing the routes and showing the requested page, 
orchestrating the data call to pass to the views

The layer-based architecture provides an application design style based on business rules. In applications that implement DDD, MVC is part of the presentation layer to decouple the domain rules from the application.
